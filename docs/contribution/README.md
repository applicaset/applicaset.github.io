## Extending

We are welcome to add new parts to this toolset.
If you had any idea or proposal just tell us.
So we can add a new repo for it and you can contribute to make this toolset stronger and more complete.

## Conventions

We have a list conventions and rules for developing these tools,
and you should use them to make them uniformed.
This list updates over the time.
Also, you can help us to improve it by telling your suggestions and feedback.
