# the Story

We are developers, and we developed applications for companies for years with Golang.

We found that many parts of applications are the same and repetitive.

As we believe in [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), so we started to write these parts in a
way that are configurable and improve them in time.

Now we can write them once and use them in most projects that we develop.

Also, we can invest time on improving them in performance and security.

We know nothing is perfect. Even the code in successful companies products with a dozen of developers has a poor
quality. So we decided to open source this toolset, and we hope this would be useful for other developers and wish some
of them help us to improve it by their contribution.
